# dotfiles
This repository contains the dotfiles (configuration files) that I use on my Linux machines. It includes
configuration files for programs such as:

- NeoVim \
- i3 Window Manager \
- i3blocks

Along with including scripts for `i3blocks` and `dwmblocks`. The default window manager that I use is my build
of Suckless DWM, which you can obtain at the [dwm-jakob](https://git.gay/regsvr64/dwm-jakob) repository.
